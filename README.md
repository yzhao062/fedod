FedOD: Federated Outlier Detection via Neural Network Approximation
===================================================================

-----


**Background**: Outlier detection (OD) is a key data mining task for identifying abnormal objects from general samples with numerous high-stake applications including fraud detection and intrusion detection.

we introduce FedOD, the first federated learning (FL)-based system designed for general OD algorithms. FedOD effectively overcomes the privacy and efficiency
challenges inherent in classical OD algorithms by automatically decomposing these algorithms into a set of basic operators and approximating their behaviors using neural networks.
